# ghimire-duan-FIP

This is our FIP project. We have done rebranding of one of the famous drink of 90's known by the name Zima. In this website you will find home page, product page and contact page. The whole website is responsive and works on every size. To make this more interesting we have added few effects and array in js to display content.
